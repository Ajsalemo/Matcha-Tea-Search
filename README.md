### Search
<br>
A user can select the dropdown to choose anywhere between a 1 to 25 mile search radius, starting at the default of 5 results, all the way up to 25.

The returned results will display the businesses image, hours of businesses, full address, price range, reviews, a link for directions using Maps URL(this will open Google Maps if installed, if not - it'll open in the browser), and their phone number.
